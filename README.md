# Water Mirror Cleaner Robot 

## Project Overview

I developed this project as my scientific initiation as a CNPq's fellow, from August 2018 to July 2019. The scientific initiation aimed to develop a code for a robot to perform the cleaning of generic water mirrors in an autonomous way and to analyze its energy consumption. The following activities were developed:

* Development of the algorithm and code, programming in MATLAB.
* Assembly of the prototype using the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT kit.
* Data analysis and treatment using Excel.
* Study and application of numerical methods for filtering and interpolating data.

## Before running the codes...

To do the robot go through the water mirror, it's necessary 
you only need to run the "main.m" file, but before you do that, you need to
