# Description

The project is completely generic, working for any water mirror. As explained earlier, you only need a _graph's vertices file_ and a _trajectory file_ of a given water mirror. To test the developed codes, I used the following water mirrors:

* [ufabc-water-mirror](https://github.com/Brunocds/cleaning-robot/tree/master/files-to-be-read/ufabc-water-mirror): these files are from the water mirror of my university.
  * ufabc.fe: the graph's vertices file.
  * trj.txt: the trajectory file.
  
* [artur-third-graph](https://github.com/Brunocds/cleaning-robot/tree/master/files-to-be-read/artur-third-graph): these files are from a theorical water mirror that I used to test the initial versions of my codes. 
  * artur_third.fe: the graph's vertices file.
  * trj9c.txt: the trajectory file.
